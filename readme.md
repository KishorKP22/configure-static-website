# üåç Static Website Hosting with Amazon S3 and CloudFront

Hello! üëã  
In this project, I have successfully hosted a static website using **Amazon S3** and **CloudFront**. This setup helps in loading the website faster and makes it available worldwide. Below are the steps I followed to complete this project.

---

## üßæ Project Overview

- Hosted a static website on **S3 bucket**
- Connected it with **CloudFront** for global delivery
- Enabled **OAC (Origin Access Control)** for security
- Configured **HTTPS**, **index.html**, and **error.html**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Process

### ‚úÖ 1. Created an S3 Bucket

- **Bucket Name**: `confg-static-website-14-06`
- Region: `ap-south-1 (Mumbai)`
- Disabled "Block all public access" (for initial testing, later secured using OAC)
- Enabled **Static Website Hosting**
  - **Index document**: `index.html`
  - **Error document**: `error.html`
- Uploaded:
  - `index.html` (Home page)
  - `error.html` (Error page)

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Created CloudFront Distribution

- Opened **CloudFront** > Created **Web Distribution**
- **Origin domain**: Selected `confg-static-website-14-06.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com` (REST endpoint)
- **Created new Origin Access Control (OAC)**:
  - Name: `S3-OAC-Static-Site`
  - Signing Behavior: **Sign requests (recommended)**
  - Origin Type: S3
- Set **Default root object**: `index.html`
- Viewer protocol policy: **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**
- Cache policy: `CachingOptimized`

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Updated Bucket Policy for OAC Access

After the CloudFront distribution was created, I updated my S3 bucket policy to allow CloudFront to access it securely.

#### üîê S3 Bucket Policy Used:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontServicePrincipalReadOnly",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::confg-static-website-14-06/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::<YOUR-AWS-ACCOUNT-ID>:distribution/<YOUR-DISTRIBUTION-ID>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

üìù Replace `<YOUR-AWS-ACCOUNT-ID>` and `<YOUR-DISTRIBUTION-ID>` with your actual values.

### ‚úÖ 4. Accessing My Website

- Once the status was **Deployed**, I copied the **CloudFront Domain Name**:
  ```
  https://dxxxxxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net
  ```
- Pasted it in the browser, and my `index.html` page loaded perfectly!

## üìÑ My HTML Files

### üîπ `index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Welcome</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Static Website</h1>
  <p>This website is hosted using Amazon S3 and served via CloudFront.</p>

```

### üîπ `error.html`

<body>
  <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
  <p>Sorry, the page you're looking for does not exist.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
